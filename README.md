# ZapierRemote
A simple "remote control" that pushes data to Zapier to trigger actions/zaps.
Built with MIT's AppInventor (http://appinventor.mit.edu/) and uses
Zapier's WebHooks "app".

* Alas, Zapier's WebHooks is now a Premium offering so it doesn't work for free Zapier accounts  :(

# AppInventor Set-Up
Create a new (free) account at AppInventor:
* http://appinventor.mit.edu/
* Click on the orange "Create Apps!" button near the top-left
* Sign up for a new account or sign in to an old account
* Under the "Projects" menu --> "Import project (.aia) from my computer..."
  * select the ZapierButtons2.aia file in this repos
* You can test the app with the "AI Companion" app
  * On the Google-Play store, search for "AI Companion" and you should see it (orange icon with a hexagon+bee on it)
  * Install that on your (Android) phone

# Zapier Set-Up
Create a new account at https://zapier.com/:
* "Log In" or "Sign Up"  
* errmm ... more to come, when configuring the WebHooks app, you'll be given a unique URL

# Zapier-Remote Set-Up
* Take the unique URL from Zapier and enter it into the "Settings" page of the app
